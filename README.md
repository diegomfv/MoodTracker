# MoodTracker

Note: This project is outdated. Please, check MoodTracker V2.

MoodTracker is a simple app that allows you to record your mood within the application on a daily basis. If you want, you can add a note to give more information on why you're feeling a certain way (ex. "I got a new job! ðŸ˜ƒ" or "There was no cheesecake left for dessert ðŸ˜ž "). 

Your mood history is saved for a week, allowing you to see your general mood trends. Any comment you've left can also be consulted. Additionally, you can see your mood history in a pie chart.
